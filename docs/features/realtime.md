## Real Time Support

When traveling with public transport services, many things can go wrong. In such a situation, information is key to finding a solution. MOTIS is capable of incorporating real time information into the data model and find a Pareto optimal connection even in disturbed situations. This includes not just delays but also cancellations, reroutings, additional trains, track changes and even free text messages that can be sent by the mobility service provider (e.g. the train operator company) to give guidance in the chaos.

Real-time data can be processed in either the proprietary RISML format (developed at Deutsche Bahn) or the common standard format GTFS-RT. The GTFS RT support was implemented by Leon Steiner in the summer semester of 2019.
